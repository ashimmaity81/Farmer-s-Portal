# Farmer-s-Portal
I'm currently working on making some changes and implementing new functions in it


The Farmer’s Portal website, developed in March 2025, is a comprehensive, feature-rich platform built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL. It is designed to empower Indian farmers with a wide range of agricultural services and real-time information, especially focusing on accessibility and ease of use for rural users. The portal includes six major modules and offers multilingual support in 18 Indian languages, making it accessible to over 80% of the rural population. A secure login system with password authentication is linked to a MySQL database, tested with over 30 dummy user entries to ensure stability and personalized access. One of the core features is the integration of government APIs to provide real-time Mandi prices for 50+ crops across all Indian states and Union Territories, helping farmers make informed selling decisions. The portal also features dynamic crop cultivation modules offering step-by-step guidance for 25+ crops, alongside weather forecasting powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. This provides 5-day temperature trends and 7-day rainfall predictions across 100+ districts. Additionally, the site includes curated information on 10+ financial schemes, storage solutions, loan options, and export-ready agri-products. A dedicated FAQ section addresses common concerns, and an AI-enabled chatbot is implemented to respond to over 100 agricultural queries, ensuring quick and reliable assistance. This project reflects practical problem-solving through full-stack development tailored for India’s farming community.
